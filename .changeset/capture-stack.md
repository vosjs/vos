The capture template takes `capture.stack` (each stack entry's data by id, the shape the bridge's LOAD carries) and hands it to `initVos` as `deps.stack`, so a host that resolves the main data's media URLs for a capture page can resolve the entries' too. Without it a program's own layers ran on the data baked into the module, and a relative key there (a studio image overlay on a hosted take) never loaded on a render page's synthetic origin: the still and the preview drew the words and lost the mark. render-core's `@vosjs/core/audio` pin follows the core patch.
