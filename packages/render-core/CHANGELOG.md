# @vosjs/render-core

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 598cec7: READMEs rewritten against the current API: every example compiles against the exported signatures, each package lists its real exports, and stale package names and moved modules are gone.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7b25557: The fleet's pages leave the package: `buildFinalizeConcatPage`, `buildAudioMixPage`, `buildDigestPage` and `buildImageDiffPage` were a hosted render fleet's own harness (an ingest route's part names, a finalize stage contract, an ops canary), not the render math any host needs. What stays is what the local `vos render` runs: `planChunks`, the mediabunny concat and mux, and the audio producer. A host that needs those pages keeps them beside its queue consumer, in sync with `concat.ts` for packet parity.
